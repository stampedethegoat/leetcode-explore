## Overview
We may access a random element by index in Array. However, we might want to restrict the processing order.

2 Processing Orders:  
  * FIFO (First-In-First-Out) - Queue  
  * LIFO (Lirst-In-First-Out) - Stack  

We go through
  * Definition
  * Implementation
  * Built-in Functions

1. Understand LIFO vs FIFO
2. Implement Stack and Queue
3. Solve Queue-related questions (BFS)
4. Solve Stack-related questions (DFS)
5. Understand system stack (DFS) and Recursion-relatd problems

## Queue [FIFO]
1. Understand FIFO and Queue  
In FIFO, the 1st element added will be processed first.

Insert - Enqueue (Added at the end of the queue)
Delete - Dequeue (Delete the 1st element)

2. Implement Queue
3. Be familiar with built-in queue structure
4. Use queue to solve simple problems
